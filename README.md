Project motivation:
I can't make a decision for the life of me, regardless of size. I have started on this journey to hopefully eventually help myself and those like me make better decisions, faster and make them more reflectable for later judgements.

Design:
I wanted the whole site to be floral themed to fit the title of the site. It's a great color scheme and makes things very readable while also maximizing colors that promote calm and rational thinking.

Code Structure:
Using the google places api, once a user selects a path, it creates a query for that path and redirects to my path that handles the google place API and searches for the correct restaurants. In the future I plan on adding a questions path, which would give more queries to the Places API for more accurate and customized results.
